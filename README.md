# Linux System Admin Journey 🚀

This repo documents my journey toward becoming a **Linux System Administrator**, with a strong foundation in networking (CompTIA Network+) and smart integration of cloud literacy for modern IT roles.

## 💻 What I'm Working On:
- Linux terminal proficiency and system structure
- Bash scripting for automation and admin tasks
- User, group, and permission management
- System services and journaling (`systemctl`, `journalctl`)
- Networking basics (`ip`, `ping`, `netstat`, etc.)
- Git & GitHub for version control and documentation
- Light cloud integration (AWS EC2, SSH, remote instance access)

└── terminal-drills/   # Daily CLI drills
```

## 📌 Goals & Roadmap

- [x] Set up Linux and GitHub
- [x] Create and push first bash script
- [ ] Automate tasks with cron
- [ ] Configure firewall and basic networking
- [ ] Launch EC2 instance and connect via SSH (cloud literacy)
- [ ] Build a mock system monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Explore log rotation and basic monitoring tools

## 🌐 Why Cloud Literacy?
Modern system administrators often work with hybrid or cloud-based environments. Understanding how to connect to and manage Linux servers in the cloud makes me more versatile and valuable in real-world IT environments.
